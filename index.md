## Welcome to Yueran's Pages

Hello, My name is Pan Yueran. Capital letters are __PY__ and __R__, which mean __python__ and __R__. So I am meant to devote my life to data science. I achieved MSc Data Science with distinction in London School of Economics and Political Science and BSc Statistic in Wuhan University before. 
Currently I am a PhD candidate in WHU. Most of my study are about applying data analysis methods to help autism
, including 
machine learning, quantitative text analysis for presidents speeches and novels,

database construction about ecommerce trade history,

I took a solid internship in Tencent last year, which was about preprocessing data for text detection.
Apart from work and study, I frequently atteend activities like Google Developer Group Festival

tried to apply to an exchange program before and even received the offer. Unfortunately, I
got stuck by some complex administrative process in my home university. This time, I do not
want to lose the opportunity again.
Today I am applying for the position of a research assistant mainly for prepareing phd study. Wish I can
