## Welcome to Yueran's Pages

Hello, My name is Yueran Pan. In Chinese pinyin order, my names' capital letters are __PY__ and __R__, which means __Python__ and __R__, so I am fated to devote my life to data science. I achieved MSc Data Science with distinction at [the London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk) and BSc Statistics at [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn). I have two-year research experience in SMIIP Lab at  [Duke Kunshan University](https://dukekunshan.edu.cn). Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science supervised by [Ming Li](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ming_Li372)  at Wuhan University. Most of my studies are about applying data analysis methods to help children with autism. I believe that AI would share my love.

### Responsive Social Smile: A Machine Learning based Multimodal Behavior Assessment Framework towards Early Stage Autism Screening
International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2020

To standardize the process of ASD screening, we design a ”Responsive Social Smile” protocol and the associated experimental setup. Moreover, we propose a machine learning based assessment framework for early ASD screening. By integrating speech recognition and computer vision technologies, the proposed framework can quantitatively analyze children’s behaviors under well-designed protocols.

### A Multimodal Framework for Automated Teaching Quality Assessment of One-to-many Online Instruction Videos
International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2022

#### *Abstract*
We design an evaluation protocol and propose a multimodal machine learning framework for automated teaching quality assessment of one-to-many online instruction videos. Our framework evaluates online teaching quality from five aspects, namely Clarity, Classroom interaction, Technical management of online teaching, Empathy, and Time management. Our method includes mid-level behavior feature extraction, high-level interpretable feature extraction, and supervised learning prediction.
