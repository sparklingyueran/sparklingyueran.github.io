## Welcome to Yueran's Pages

Hello, My name is Yueran Pan. In Chinese pinyin order, capital letters of my name are __PY__ and __R__, which means __python__ and __R__, so I am fated to devote my life to data science. I achieved MSc Data Science with distinction at [the London School of Economics and Political Science](www.lse.ac.uk) and BSc Statistics at [Wuhan University](www.whu.edu.cn). I have two-year research experience in SMIIP Lab at  [Duke Kunshan University](https://dukekunshan.edu.cn). Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science supervised by [Ming Li](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ming_Li372)  at Wuhan University. Most of my studies are about applying data analysis methods to help children with autism. I believe that AI would share my love.
